By heading to http://sotd.us/jacobkayfes/MobileApplicationDevelopment/MadMod6/Mod6Project/Homepage.html you can use the site on both mobile and desktop atmospheres.
Below will be a description of buttons on each page, the user actions, and the outcomes or results when they are clicked.

When the site is accesed the user will see a filtered unorginized list of video games. If the user clicks of an item on the list they will be brought to a page
that contains a brief review by me of the game. The user can click on a back button to return to the home page at anytime.
The user can also access a panel labeled as navigation that opens a list of options that a organized. If the user clicks the To Survey button they will be brought
to another page that has a list with one button that brings the user to a form page. Here the user can interact with sliders and text boxes as well as use website storage
to add to a list of pies. The next user will see whatever the last user entered.
The next 4 options on the panel will bring the user to various websites including Youtube, google, Igns reviews, and rassmussen universitys website.\
lastly a grid can be acces at the bottom of the homepage and acts as a list of pies that are already addded to the list referenced in the webstorage portion of the forms.
This site has been 6 week passion project that I thoughly enjoyed creating.
